## Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.

*   A *library* is a collection of files (called *modules*) that contains
    functions for use by other programs.
    *   May also contain data values (e.g., numerical constants) and other things.
    *   Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.
*   The Python [standard library][stdlib] is an extensive suite of modules that comes
    with Python itself.
*   Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI][pypi] (the Python Package Index).

## A program must import a library module before using it.

*   Use `import` to load a library module into a program's memory.
*   Then refer to things from the module as `module_name.thing_name`.
    *   Python uses `.` to mean "part of".
*   Using `math`, one of the modules in the standard library:

~~~
import math

print('pi is', math.pi)
print('cos(pi) is', math.cos(math.pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
pi is 3.141592653589793
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   Have to refer to each item with the module's name.
    *   `math.cos(pi)` won't work: the reference to `pi`
        doesn't somehow "inherit" the function's reference to `math`.

## Use `help` to learn about the contents of a library module.

*   Works just like help for a function.

~~~
help(math)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Help on module math:

NAME
    math

MODULE REFERENCE

    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is always available.  It provides access to the
    mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(x, /)
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.

## Import specific items from a library module to shorten programs.

*   Use `from ... import ...` to load only specific items from a library module.
*   Then refer to them directly without library name as prefix.

~~~
from math import cos, pi

print('cos(pi) is', cos(pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

## Create an alias for a library module when importing it to shorten programs.

*   Use `import ... as ...` to give a library a short *alias* while importing it.
*   Then refer to items in the library using that shortened name.

~~~
import math as m

print('cos(pi) is', m.cos(m.pi))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
cos(pi) is -1.0
~~~
{: .output}

*   Commonly used for libraries that are frequently used or have long names.
    *   E.g., the `matplotlib` plotting library is often aliased as `mpl`.
*   But can make programs harder to understand,
    since readers must learn your program's aliases.

> 2. Do you find this version easier to read than preceding ones?
> 3. Why *wouldn't* programmers always use this form of `import`?
